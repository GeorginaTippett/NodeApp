This is a very basic Node application that I made to get Node.js set up on my home laptop and get some practice using it.

It was my first attempt at using the Express Generator and is the first Node application Iâ€™ve ever attempted. Made using Atom as my editor and testing on Chrome with JSON formatter installed as extension.

It creates a basic server that returns some JSON that you can run on local host.

I made this by following a brilliant online tutorial by Brian Voong (credit - letsbuildthatapp.com). Thank you!
